# Pixabay image store

This is not a wallpaper distribution but rather derivative work as embedded in
a GNU/linux distribution.

If you want to find a repository of good wallpapers you are encouraged to
browse pixabay. All images here can be traced to their source through the
[attributions-file](attributions.md).

Given this, I belive images herein are properly and lawfully used according to
the pixabay license.
