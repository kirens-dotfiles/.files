 GENERAL

   * look into using servo for emeded sites / webbrowser, sequrity aspects?
     Alternatively how to get Firefox to launch webiste in "kiosk-mode"
   * using `logger` in some config-scipts?

 FISH

   * fish conf dir should be a symlink so functions can be loaded ad hoc

 VIM

   * nvim as standard editor
   * look into neovim coloring errors
   * Code Completeion (specifically Haskell/Javascript/Python/Java)

 NIXOS

   * Separate hardware-config
   * mullvad vpn
   * acpid - lid close -> sleep-pc
   * Is there some kind of user.nix config? Might be worth trying to migrate
     some configs from fish / X11 stuff to it in that case.

 XMONAD
 
   * Create typeclass for Keybinding to make script extendable
   * Custom Layout, allowing:
      On top - Fullscren / out of workspace programms (for things such as calendar, messaging, todos)  
   * xscreensaver
   * editTODO shortcut should autocommit + -push

 KEYBOARD

   * Create Prototype (Dactyl based)
     - Install and get familiar with OpanSCAD
     - Get familiar with printing
     - Print keyboard parts without modification
     - Order the needed parts
     - Build it
     - ...?
